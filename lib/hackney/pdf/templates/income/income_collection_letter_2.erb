  <p>
    Further to our previous letter about your rent payments, I am writing to repeat our offer to support you if you need it during this difficult time and ask to ask that you get in touch to discuss any problems you are having paying your rent
  </p>

  <p>
    We know that the coronavirus pandemic has had a direct impact on many people in Hackney, including financially. If you are in financial difficulty, you may qualify for some of the other support packages the Council has introduced to help those who are affected by the pandemic.

      What you need to do:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Contact us in one of the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By telephone on 020 8356 3100
      </li>
      <li>
        By email at <strong>income.services@hackney.gov.uk</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Through someone who helps you, such as a friend, carer or advice agency like the Citizens Advice Bureau. We will ask them for proof that you have given them permission to discuss your account first.

    </ul>

      What will happen next?
    </h3>

    <p>
      If you contact us, it will help us to understand why your account is in arrears. We can help you if you are struggling financially by either telling you about benefits you might be entitled to, referring you for budgeting support or debt advice or making an affordable repayment agreement. We can only help you if you talk to us.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you don’t talk to us, and we can’t solve the problem we may issue a Notice of Seeking Possession. While we are not evicting tenants who are impacted financially by the coronavirus crisis, this is the first step towards eviction if we need to in the future.
