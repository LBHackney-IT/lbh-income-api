      What will happen next?
    </h3>

    <p>
      If you contact us, it will help us to understand why your account is in arrears. We can help you if you are struggling financially by either telling you about benefits you might be entitled to, referring you for budgeting support or debt advice or making an affordable repayment agreement. We can only help you if you talk to us.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you don't talk to us, and we can't solve the problem, you will receive a Notice of Seeking Possession, which is the first step towards eviction. We want to avoid this.
